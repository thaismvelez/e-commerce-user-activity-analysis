# E-Commerce User Activity Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes activity logs from an e-commerce platform to understand user behavior and retention patterns. It covers funnel building, cohort analysis preparation, and retention tracking, with findings presented in a professional, easy-to-read format.

## Data Set
The dataset used for this analysis includes logs of user activities on the e-commerce platform. Each row represents an event, such as a product page view, shopping cart opening, or purchase, with the following columns:

- `user_id`: Unique customer ID
- `event_type`: Type of activity (e.g., page view, add to cart, purchase)
- `category_code`: Category of the product
- `brand`: Manufacturer of the product
- `price`: Price of the product in USD
- `event_date`: Date of user activity in YYYY-MM-DD format

## Introduction
As a new junior analyst at an e-commerce company, I was tasked with analyzing raw user activity logs to understand how customers interact with the website. The project focuses on building a conversion funnel, conducting cohort analysis, and calculating retention rates to uncover insights that improve engagement and conversions.

## Project Objectives

1. Build a conversion funnel to understand how well product page views convert into purchases.
2. Create acquisition cohorts based on the month of a user's first purchase and track retention month-by-month.
3. Calculate retention rates and summarize insights for each cohort.
4. Organize, document, and format the analysis for executive presentation.

## Methodology

1. **Conversion Funnel Analysis:** Built a conversion funnel in a pivot table to track user movement through three stages (views, adds to cart, and purchases). Calculated overall and next-step conversion rates.
2. **Cohort Preparation and Analysis:** Filtered the dataset to isolate purchase events and created acquisition cohorts based on the first purchase month. Monthly data columns were generated to track the age of each cohort, enabling detailed retention tracking.
3. **Retention Rate Calculation:** Aggregated the purchase data into cohorts and calculated retention rates for each cohort over a four-month period.
4. **Documentation and Formatting:** Summarized the results in an executive summary sheet, organized sheets for easy navigation, and formatted tables for readability.
